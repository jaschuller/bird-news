// TODO Results display the following (up to 5 items on initial return):
// Username
// Avatar of the author
// Url of the tweet

// TODO Consider "Load more" component to lazy load the next 5 tweets into the results
// this will either be part of this Results component or its on separate component.

// Consider Search as part of this component, since it is the same dimensions it might be
// simpler to build it in this component as a first pass

// TODO Load more should update the Filter with unique hashtags from next set of results
// Consider how this interacts with those which have already been filtered out**
